    <h3 class="header">Your eyes open. Somehow, you already know that you are in an elevator in Beijing on a dark and stormy night. You know this because the elevator doors have a sign that says, "Welcome to Beijing!" in faded letters. Someone has graffiti'd one of those unintelligible scrawls that resemble a signature over it. The sound of thunder and rain can also be heard against the elevator shaft. You wonder for a moment why there seems to be no building around the elevator shaft, but you abandon the thought upon realizing there are people in the elevator with you. They are dressed for work and all Chinese. Unfortunately, you do not know Mandarin.
