    <h3 class="header">You are immediately greeted by one of those intern-types. You know, the ones who you see running around the office doing trivial, pointless tasks. He pulls you to a desk, which surprisingly already has a sticker with your name plastered on it. You pick up the stapler on the desk, and see it also has your name stickered onto it. A packet of paper is lying in the center of the desk. The cover reads, "WORKING IN HELL: INSTRUCTION MANUAL".
