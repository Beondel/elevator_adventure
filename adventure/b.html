    <h3 class="header">The elevator stops with a sudden, distinct lack of momentum. Then, there is a sudden, distinct presence of momentum. In the opposite direction. You realize that inertia had been the only thing keeping the elevator moving upward, and that the force of gravity is now taking over. None of the other people in the elevator appear to notice. They stand there with the thousand yard stare of the proletariat, briefcases in hand and headphones in ears. There seems to be an inevitable conclusion of death.
