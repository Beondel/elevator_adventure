    <h3 class="header">You change into your swimsuit, which is lying on the chair, and attempt to suntan. Unfortunately, the light source, which you thought to be the sun, slowly materializes into the shape of a fluorescent lightbulb as your vision adjusts to the change in lighting. This also means that the air around you isn't as hot sas you thought it was. Indeed, with most of your clothes off, it seems like you're standing in an Arctic wasteland. The polar bear lumbering by doesn't help in convincing you otherwise.
