    <h3 class="header">The doors close. Wait, they're already closed. Somehow, they give off an optical illusion or something of closing despite being closed. The other people walk through the elevator doors in single file. Wasn't that closed just a moment ago? You should stop blinking so often. Through the doors, you can see a completely white space filled with cubicles seemingly placed at random. Smooth jazz starts playing in the elevator.
