Your eyes open. Somehow, you already know that you are in an elevator in Beijing on a dark and stormy night. You know this because the elevator doors have a sign that says, "Welcome to Beijing!" in faded letters. Someone has graffiti'd one of those unintelligible scrawls that resemble a signature over it. The sound of thunder and rain can also be heard against the elevator shaft. You wonder for a moment why there seems to be no building around the elevator shaft, but you abandon the thought upon realizing there are people in the elevator with you. They are dressed for work and all Chinese. Unfortunately, you do not know Mandarin.

A. Flail your arms and shout gibberish in an attempt to communicate.
B. Press the ELEVATOR STOP button.
C. Check your phone.
D. Wait.

A. None of the other people in the elevator appear to notice your actions. They stand there with the thousand yard stare of the proletariat, briefcases in hand and headphones in ears. After several seconds of stillness from within, the elevator pings and there is a sudden, distinct lack of momentum. The elevator floor display shows "8".

E. Press the DOOR OPEN button.
F. Press the DOOR CLOSE button.
G. Wait.

B. The elevator stops with a sudden, distinct lack of momentum. Then, there is a sudden, distinct presence of momentum. In the opposite direction. You realize that inertia had been the only thing keeping the elevator moving upward, and that the force of gravity is now taking over. None of the other people in the elevator appear to notice. They stand there with the thousand yard stare of the proletariat, briefcases in hand and headphones in ears. There seems to be an inevitable conclusion of death.

H. Press random buttons on the elevator.
I. Wait.

C. Your phone displays the date. It is Tuesday, May 18. Then, you remember that's the sticker you put on the front of your phone. D'oh. Your phone refuses to turn on, since the battery has been removed. You have no other last resort to divert your attention toward. Your eyes naturally track downward to your feet. Suddenly, you notice an iPhone battery lying there.

J. Pick it up.
K. Step on it.
L. Wait.

D. After several seconds of non-motion, the elevator pings and there is a sudden, distinct lack of momentum. The elevator floor display shows "13". Just kidding, that's a "B". The doors open into what feels like a large, open space filled with blackness. A slight, warm breeze with a hint of salt blows into the elevator. It reminds you of the sea.

M. Leave the elevator.
N. Wait.

E. The doors open for a split second, exposing you to the full force of the Sun's radiation. Somehow, the elevator has stopped 15 meters from the surface of the star. You don't even have time to ponder how this is physically possible before you perish.

GAME OVER.

F. The doors close. Wait, they're already closed. Somehow, they give off an optical illusion or something of closing despite being closed.
